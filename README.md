# Hartley Transform Research
A research project for the course Digital Signal Processing. The repository presents an analysis of the Hartley transform, 
its implementation in Python, and its applications. Main aspects, analyzed in the project:
* Frequency Amplitude Interpretation: Analysis of negative and positive frequency amplitudes in the Hartley domain.
* Signal Reconstruction: Methods and techniques for reconstructing original signals from Hartley transform outputs.
* Time Domain Information Encoding: Examining how the Hartley transform captures and represents time domain data.
* Innovative Methods: An approach for separating encoded data into magnitude and frequency amplitude ratios.
